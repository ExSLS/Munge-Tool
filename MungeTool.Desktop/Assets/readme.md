The merge-icon.svg file is the master copy of the main application icon. If you need to edit/tweak the icon - then edit the SVG file (I recommend using the free [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) editor), and run convert-to-ico.ps1. Note that this script requires [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) to be installed. This script will update the `MungeTool.Desktop\merge.ico` file, which is what the application uses.
